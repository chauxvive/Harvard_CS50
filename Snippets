//These are specifically exercises that are not part of the CS50 labs, things that come up in class, etc. Show your Work, is what I say! 

//Assignment: 
//A simple problem getting us familiar with C.
//Make a code that asks a name, age, and phone, and then prints it back to the user.

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
	string name = get_string("Name: \n");
	string age = get_string("Age: \n");
	string phone = get_string("phone : \n");

	printf("Name: %s\n Age: %s\n Phone %s\n", name, age, phone);

}


//Population attempt 2:

//I was very confused the first time I did this problem because I accidentally did problem set 1 too early. Once I understood the C basics better, I decided to do it over on my own.
//This is my new attempt.

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
// ask for a starting value

int start;
do {
    start = get_int("Starting Value: \n");
}
while (start < 9);

//ask for an end value

int end;
do {
    end = get_int("Ending value: \n");
}
while (start > end);

//calculate how many years
    int years = 0;
    int population = start;
    while (population < end)
    {
        int births = population / 3;
        int deaths = population / 4;
        population += births - deaths;
        years++;
    }

//print number of years to get to end value
printf("Number of years: %i\n", years);

return 0;
