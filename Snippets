//These are specifically exercises that are not part of the CS50 labs, things that come up in class, etc. Show your Work, is what I say! 

//Assignment: 
//A simple problem getting us familiar with C.
//Make a code that asks a name, age, and phone, and then prints it back to the user.

#include <cs50.h>
